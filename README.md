# ML-Data_Preprocessing
Data Pre Processing for Machine Learning 

📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement a robust data preprocessing pipeline that improves the quality, reliability, and usefulness of raw data for machine learning applications.

⚙️ Key Steps
1. Data Exploration

       Explored dataset structure and unique values per column
       Performed statistical analysis
       Renamed columns for clarity
3. Data Cleaning

       Treated missing values and inappropriate entries
       Replaced Age = 0 with NaN and imputed missing values
       Removed duplicate rows
       Detected outliers using IQR method
4. Data Analysis

       Filtered dataset (Age > 40, Salary < 5000) and visualized Age vs Salary
       Counted people by Place and represented results visually
5. Data Encoding

       Converted categorical features into numerical values using:
       Label Encoding
       One-Hot Encoding
6. Feature Scaling

       Applied StandardScaler (mean = 0, std = 1)
       Applied MinMaxScaler (scaled to 0–1 range)
